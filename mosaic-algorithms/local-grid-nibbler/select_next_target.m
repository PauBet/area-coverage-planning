% Inputs:

%    > neighbours:              Coordinates of the valid neighbous
%    > poly_roi:                Polyshape object containing the remaining
%                               ROI.
%    > ptime:                   List of possible imaging times of the
%                               neighbours.
%    > footprint_func           Function handle containing the footprint
%                               function, so that only time and target
%                               coodinates are needed.
%    > rot_func                 Function handle containing the
%                               rotation/pointing function, so that only time and target
%                               coodinates are needed.
%    > count:                   Counter of fooptrint_func calls (analytical purposes)
% Outputs:
