function opposite = get_opposite_neigh(neigh)
% Since the neighbours are included in a 3x3 grid each neighbour that in
% not in a diagonal position, has a opposite neighbour. When the algorithms
% reaches an edge of the ROI, it has to move down or up, and start moving
% in the opposite direction, which is given by this function.
