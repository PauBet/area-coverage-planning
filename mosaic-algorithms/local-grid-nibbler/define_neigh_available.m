function neigh_indexes = define_neigh_available(dist_ind, neigh_coverage)
  
% From the coverage of the 8 possible neighbours of the current target, and knowing 
% which neighbour aligns better with the precomputed coverage path, it
% identifies a list of 4 neighbours that will be used to cover the ROI, the
% other 4 are located at unvalid locations that are not contained in the
% coverage path, therefore, they are discarded to reduce computational
% cost.

% Inputs:

%    > neigh_coverage: List with the coverage of the 8 neighbours
% Outputs:
%    > neigh_indexes: List with the indexes of the valid neighbours
