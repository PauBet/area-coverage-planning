% Inputs: 
%    > angle:                 Rolling angle
%    > target_body:           SPICE identifier of the target body e.g
%                             'EUROPA'
%    > et:                    Current instant, in TDB seconds past
%                             J2000 epoch
%    > target_orientation:    Rotation matrix corresponding to the camera
%                             (from Camera frame to IAU_TARGET)
%                             when pointing the current target at the current instant
%    > obs:                   SPICE identifier of the observer
%    > scinst:                SPICE identifier of the imaging instrumnt
%    > target_fixed:          Body fixed reference frame of the target body
%    > target:                Longitude and latitude of the current target.
%    > neigh_index:           Integer from 1 to 8 that indicates which neighbour to be computed.
