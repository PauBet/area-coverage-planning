function [A, fpList] = frontierRepair(startTime, endTime, ...
    tobs, inst, sc, target, inroi, olapx, olapy, slewRate, varargin)
% This function adjusts the observation grid and planning tour in response 
% to new observations. It takes into account changes in observation 
% geometry, incorporating new observation points, and removes points that 
% are no longer necessary for covering the region of interest (ROI).
% A Boustrophedon pattern is used to ensure efficient coverage. It has been
% adapted from [1]

% Usage:        [A, fpList] = frontierRepair(startTime, endTime, ...
%                   tobs, inst, sc, target, inroi, olapx, olapy, slewRate, ...
%                   resolution)
%
% Inputs:
%   > startTime:    start time of the planning horizon, in TDB seconds past
%                   J2000 epoch
%   > endTime:      end time of the planning horizon, in TBD seconds past
%                   J2000 epoch
%   > tobs:         observation time, i.e. the minimum time that the 
%                   instrument needs to perform an observation, in seconds
%   > inst:         string name of the instrument
%   > sc:           string name of the spacecraft
%   > target:       string name of the target body
%   > inroi:        matrix containing the vertices of the ROI polygon. The
%                   vertex points are expressed in 2D, in latitudinal 
%                   coordinates [ยบ]
%       # roi(:,1) correspond to the x values of the vertices
%       # roi(:,2) correspond to the y values of the vertices
%   > olapx:        grid footprint overlap in the x direction (longitude),
%                   in percentage (width)
%   > olapy:        grid footprint overlap in the y direction (latitude),
%                   in percentage (height)
%   > slewRate:     rate at which the spacecraft (or instrument platform)
%                   can slew between observations, in [ยบ/s]
%   > resolution:   string 'lowres' or 'highres' that determines the
%                   footprint resolution calculation. It's set to 'lowres'
%                   by default
% 
% Outputs:
%   > A:            cell matrix of successive instrument observations,
%                   sorted in chronological order.
%                   Each observation is defined by the instrument boresight
%                   projection onto the body surface, in latitudinal
%                   coordinates [lon lat], in deg
%   > fpList:       list of footprint structures detailing the observation
%                   metadata and coverage

end

% [Issue]: We cannot perform visibility and anti-meridian checks
% simultaneously. This means, either we get a sectioned ROI due to
% visibility or anti-meridian, but both may not happen. This is because the
% interpolation function does not work with anti-meridian intercepts.
