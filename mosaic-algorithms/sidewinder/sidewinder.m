% Target-fixed Boustrophedon decomposition for spacecraft observation
% planning, adapted from [1].
% This function builds a mosaic acquisition for a spacecraft over a
% specified target (ROI) within a given time frame, using a modified
% Boustrophedon decomposition approach. Additionally, it considers the
% instrument cadence, the spacecraft maneuver speed and the target
% visibility.

% Usage:        [A, fpList] = sidewinder(startTime, endTime, tobs,...
%                   inst, sc, target, inroi, olapx, olapy, slewRate, speedUp)
%
% Inputs:
%   > startTime:    start time of the planning horizon, in TDB seconds past
%                   J2000 epoch
%   > endTime:      end time of the planning horizon, in TBD seconds past
%                   J2000 epoch
%   > tobs:         observation time, i.e. the minimum time that the 
%                   instrument needs to perform an observation, in seconds
%   > inst:         string name of the instrument
%   > sc:           string name of the spacecraft
%   > target:       string name of the target body
%   > inroi:        matrix containing the vertices of the ROI polygon. The
%                   vertex points are expressed in 2D, in latitudinal 
%                   coordinates [ยบ]
%       # roi(:,1) correspond to the x values of the vertices
%       # roi(:,2) correspond to the y values of the vertices
%   > olapx:        grid footprint overlap in the x direction (longitude),
%                   in percentage (width)
%   > olapy:        grid footprint overlap in the y direction (latitude),
%                   in percentage (height)
%   > slewRate:     rate at which the spacecraft (or instrument platform)
%                   can slew between observations, in [ยบ/s]
%   > speedUp:      boolean flag to run the algorithm in a faster mode
%                   (lower resolution)
% 
% Outputs:
%   > A:            cell matrix of successive instrument observations,
%                   sorted in chronological order.
%                   Each observation is defined by the instrument boresight
%                   projection onto the body surface, in latitudinal
%                   coordinates [lon lat], in deg
%   > fpList:       list of footprint structures detailing the observation
%                   metadata and coverage

end

% [Issue]: We cannot perform visibility and anti-meridian checks
% simultaneously. This means, either we get a sectioned ROI due to
% visibility or anti-meridian, but both may not happen. This is because the
% interpolation function does not work with anti-meridian intercepts.
