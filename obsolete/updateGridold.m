% Usage:        [N, X, map] = updateGrid(roi, tour, map, olapx, ...
%                  olapy, dirx, diry, fpref)
%
% Inputs:
%   > roi:          matrix containing the vertices of the ROI polygon. The
%                   vertex points are expressed in 2D, in latitudinal 
%                   coordinates [ยบ]
%       # roi(:,1) correspond to the x values of the vertices
%       # roi(:,2) correspond to the y values of the vertices         
%   > tour:         cell matrix of the successive planned observations.
%                   Each observation is defined by the instrument boresight
%                   projection onto the body surface, in latitudinal
%                   coordinates [lon lat], in deg
%   > map:          cell matrix of grid points. In order to avoid
%                   mapping boundaries, map is bounded by NaN rows and 
%                   columns (first and last)
%   > olapx:        grid footprint overlap in the x direction,
%                   in percentage (width)
%   > olapy:        grid footprint overlap in the y direction,
%                   in percentage (height)
%   > dirx:         vector that expresses the x-direction in the grid
%   > diry:         vector that expresses the y-direction in the grid
%   > fpref:        reference footprint that will be used to define the
%                   grid spacing of the roi's discretization. See footprint
%                   function for further details

% Outputs:
%   > N:            cell matrix of the new observation points to be
%                   included in the tour
%   > X:            cell matrix of the disposable observation points to be
%                   removed from the tour
%   > map:          updated cell matrix of grid points (next observation
%                   point is removed from the map)
